/**
 * Wraps a function that accepts an argument of type [T], but the returned function will be
 * considered equal to all other functions returned from this function.
 *
 * All functions returned from this are considered equal (and have the same hashcode), which means
 * they can be stored in data classes and will not affect the equivalence of the rest of the data
 * class's properties. This makes it much easier to write test assertions for workflow renderings
 * that include event handlers, since you can compare entire rendering types at once and not
 * field-by-field.
 *
 * E.g.
 * ```
 * val foo = indistinctFunction { println("foo($it)") }
 * val bar = indistinctFunction { println("bar($it)") }
 * assertTrue(foo == bar)
 * assertTrue(foo !== bar)
 * ```
