/**
 * Given a stream of [InputT] values to use as inputs for the top-level [workflow], returns a
 * [Flow] that, when collected, will start [workflow] and emit its [Update]s. If the collection
 * is cancelled, the workflow will be terminated.
 *
 * The returned [Flow] is _not_ multicasted â€“ **every subscription will start a new workflow
 * session.** It is recommended to use a multicasting operator on the resulting stream, such as
 * [Flow.broadcastIn][kotlinx.coroutines.flow.broadcastIn], to share the updates from a single
 * workflow session.
 *
 * The workflow's logic will run in the coroutine context of the collector.
 *
 * This operator is an alternative to using
 * [WorkflowHost.Factory][com.squareup.workflow.WorkflowHost.Factory] that is more convenient to
 * use with a stream
 * of inputs.
 *
 * @param snapshot If non-null, used to restore the workflow tree from a previous [Snapshot] emitted
 * in an [Update].
