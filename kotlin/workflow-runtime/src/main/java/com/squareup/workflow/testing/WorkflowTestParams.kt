 * Defines configuration for workflow testing infrastructure such as `testRender`, `testFromStart`.

 * [from a snapshot][StartMode.StartFromSnapshot], or
 * [from a specific state][StartMode.StartFromState]. Defaults to [StartFresh].
 * @param checkRenderIdempotence If true, every render method will be called multiple times, to help
 * suss out any side effects that a render method is trying to perform. This parameter defaults to
 * `true` since the workflow contract is that `render` will be called an arbitrary number of times
 * for any given state, so performing side effects in `render` will almost always result in bugs.
 * It is recommended to leave this on, but if you need to debug a test and don't want to have to
 * deal with the extra passes, you can temporarily set it to false.
